It's a dream come true for people who loves hiking to trek in the Himalayas. Our plan to trek started last year way before our innocent mind knew nothing about the deadly pandemic which, ultimately thwartred our plans and shifted everything by an year. Our plan was to include as much as activities like bunjee jumping, River rafting in the Mighty Ganga before the commencement of the trek. This trek of nearly ten days was one of the best things to happen which without the organisation of my closest friends Ganesh, Deepak would not have been a possibility.

### Day 1 - Leaving to Dehradun

Left Shimoga on 12th of March and reached the next day morning at around 6:00AM. Our flight to Dehradun from bangalore was at 12:30PM so had to reach the airport by 10:30 AM. As soon as I reached bangalore picked the camera from my cousin's friend en route to my room. After freshning up left to Maiyyas to get a good breakfast and ate three Idlis and a Vada. After that left for Airport at 9:00AM from Jayanagar 4th Block.

It took around 2 hours and 30 minutes for us to reach Dehradun. After reaching Dehradun, we booked a cab to Rishikes as our plan was to spend time in Rishikesh for Bunjee Jumping and River Rafting. We Stayed in a zostel - GoStops Rishikesh. After reaching as some of the people were new, we had a round of introduction and then went outside to explore Rishikesh. We saw LaxumanJula spent some time taking pics. Next day was the D day, anxiety was slowly creeping in thorought the night. However Bharat's birthday gave us an oppurtunity to forget all those and we slept the night peacefully without thinking much about the challenging task which lay ahead us the next morning.


### Day 2 - The Bunjee Jumping day.
The D-Day was here. We had to get ready to do the Bunjee Jumping. We had to reach the rendezvous as early as possible.

I still remember the day as it were yesterday, my apetite had went south and I could not eat much before the jump as I was too stressed out. I ate three spoons of Maggi nearby Jumping heights and was getting ready for the jump. After getting briefed on the specifics of the jump, we started walking towards the jump site. My jump was after Rohan who did it after Aashish and Raghavendra Swaroop. After seeing Aashish's jump we came to know how one should not do the jump XD. As soon as I came to the stands, the instructor started asking me about my profession and other things, just to cool me down but deep down I knew all those would not help me getting over the fear. I somehow managed to get over to the edge of the platform, I just knew one thing, to fall down head first and thats what I did! It was a surreal experience for the first two seconds, I did not know what was happening initially for two seconds as the speed with which I was falling down blanked my head. But as soon as the first jerk was felt, I started screaming my lungs out with excitement and continued till I became stagnant after which I started telling myself everything's fine as I hanged there completely upside down by the rope. The support crew would then provide a pole to hold when I hang upside so that they can pull me and disconnect me from the harness after which I would be made to rest for 30 seconds and then provide a badge for the feat achieved. As soon as a small group hiked back the 83m we innocusouly fell, I ordered a Veg Sandwich as I was damn hungry. The hunger combined with the successful attempt of the Bunjee jump gave utmost satisfaction while eating the sandwich. After everyone was done with their Bunjee/Giant swing it was just the discussion of how one took the jump? How did one scream their lungs out (Rohan won this category by a huge margin XD) and also we ourselves were in shock as to what hell  we just did! And later took pics wearing the badge of guts provided by the Jumping heights org.

Rest of the evening was spenting once again roaming across the Lakshman jula and some other shops where we hogged a little and explained the experience to other people who had not come to jumping heights.

### Day 3 - Rafting in the Mighty Ganga
After an amazing previous day, we were all set for the next amazing thing in Rishikesh. As we were a large group, we got a sweet deal from the zostel we were staying in, as they themselves booked the river rafting for us and the Red Chillies(The Rafting org) asked us to be present at the venue by 9:00AM. Our Rafting was from Shivpuri to (destination - name to be filled later). The Journey was arround 16kms and they asked us to store all the non essentials in the bag which then would be transfferred directly to the destination point of our rafting. We were all set and they briefed us about how to row and we were all set to aboard the raft.

There were basically three commands that we were asked to follow additionally one to just duck into the boat. As we went during the end of winter season, there were no more than level 3 rapids. The experience with rafting in level 3 rapids were thrilling and it used to drain lot of energy. As soon as we were done with 7 of 8 rapids of all levels, there was a popular cliff of height 25 feet from where people were allowed to cliff jump. This is where things started going south, we had three GoPros with us, due to an unfortunate incident, one of our rafting lead while cliff diving, lost the GoPro which we had graciously given to record the last few jumps as he was the last person. The only black dot in our trip. After the incident we faced one low tide rapid were done with rafting.

We returned to our zostel to collect the main luggage we had left, had a sumptuous lunch and then left for Dehradun in a TT for the day as a long travel to sankri was awaiting us the next day early in the morning. As soon as we reached Dehradun, we had no plans of where to have lunch, we decided to go to Kumar sweets. As soon as we went there it was alreadt close its closing time, they started mentioning that several items were not there as its almost the close time, it definetly is one of the most overhyped shops in Dehradun as even the taste were extremely normal. However, as we were starving, we fortunately found a good stall -(name to be filled) who were making good momos, this is where fun started happening, as they had a bluetooth speakers and we were hungry, our hunger turned into foolishness and we all started dancing while eating and then we started changing to kannada songs by which time all the people were dancing while listening to the songs, overall it was an extremely memorable day which will be cherished for a lifetime as we headed back to the hotel.


### Day 4 - Travel to Sankri
Our TT came exactly at 5:50 AM on Tuesday, 16th of Mar, After getting ready, we had a cup of tea from the nearby hotel stall and started our joureny at 6 in the morning. The roads along the way were narrow along the cliff and the views along the way were absolutely magical and terrfying at the same time. We stopped for breakfast at mussori and ate the infamous north indian breakfast, Aloo paratha on the way. Before lunch we stopped at a rock point which was on the banks of the river Yamuna and took several pics. For our lunch we stopped at this extremely lovable daba by an aunty who won our hearts as we ate our hearts out in harki dun valley. later, we reached Sankri at around 4:30 PM - 5:00 PM. We got freshned up at the rooms given and assembled at the dining area where our Trek leader mannu bayya briefed us about our trek guide team consisting of himself and two others : Sanjeev bhayya and Ms. Sunita. He also enquired us about our fitness level and briefed us on the itenary of the trek, the do's and dont's on the trek, the clothing required etc. After the meeting, we had our dinner and we were extremely surprised by the taste and quality of the food provided by the TTH people. After the dinner, we got to know about a cafe which provided wifi for people buying there. We utlized this to send messages to our family and said we will not get the signal for the next 4 days. As the temperature had started falling, we layered up and went to bed after getting our only essential items in the trek bag and seperated the othem items as "left luggage" which had to be dropped off before leaving early morning.

### Day 5 - First day of trek
The plan for the first day was to have our tea at 7:00 AM. Sipping the lemon tea which was given, the scenery just outside the dining camp at sankri camp was nothing short of magnificent, we were able to see some of the most beautiful valleys, snow covered top of several summit peaks. Our trek was scheduled to start at 9:00 AM after the 8:00 AM breakfast. However, we started 10 min late and we were on foot at 9:15 AM where we left from Sankri to reach Juda ki talab.

Our first day of trek was nothing short of breathtking, the route with which we had to travel was covered with beautiful pine trees. Our guide Sanjeev bhaiyya throughout the trek was interacting with us explaning about different types of flowers in these pine forest and also was educating us on the do and dont's as we trekked through the thick patch of forest. We reached juda ki talab at around 2:00 PM and saw the glimpses of snow near the lake. The travel distance was close to around 5-5.5 KM with a good ascent.

After a good lunch, we started the acclimitisation walk. After reaching the higher altitude where snow were plentiful, we played cricket with our hiking pole with snow balls as our trek leader mannu bayya explained about the naturally formed rock caves around the place.

### Day 6 - Trek to Kedarkanta Base Camp
As the distance to the kedarkanta base camp was less, our trek started a bit late as we had our tea at 8:00 AM. Everyone was up and as the temperature was around 0-5C, it was extremely difficult to use the water to wash our face/brush our teeth. Also, everyone felt victorious after attending their first nature call in the woods XD. After some warmup and breakfast consisting of pasta, we started to kedarkanta base camp at 10:00 AM . The path considerably was much steeper than our first day and the snow patches were starting to get noticed more and more as we were covering altitude. Also as we started climbing the density of pine trees started reducing. We reached kedarkanta base camp very early as the distance was just around 2.5kms. As there were less pine trees at the Kedarkanta base camp,  we were able to witness the complete 360$$^\circ$$ view.

After a good lunch, the scenic view of the campsite urged evryone to take 100s of pics with the background. After a while, for our acclimtisation walk, or trek leaders took us to a place which contained a large patch of snow and for us that definetly was like giving a candy to a child. We started playing with snow, some also created snowman, some played snowball targets.

### Day 7 - The Summit day
Ah the summit day, we had to wake up as early as 1:00 AM so that we could leave the kedarkanta base camp at 3:00 AM. The weather was brutally cold, probably near the 0C range. There was tea at 1:00 AM and Maggi was served at 2:00 AM as our breakfast. They also provided frooti and enrgy bars to assist our summit climb. We started the summit a little late at around 3:15 AM. As my head torch was extremely unreliable,  I closely followed behind Megha till dawn. We had three breakpoints along our summit in which the second one was in an abandoned hut where we started breathing fumes due the low temperature. We travlled around 3.5 - 4 km from where we started to witness the early dawn and the kedarkanta peak at around 5:00 AM and Oh boy was it not stunning!

Even though the peak seemed near, it was actually not so near as one think. We had still around 45 min of climb left. We slowly climbed the peak savouring the moment of sunrise and it was around 6:30 AM when we reached the peak and the view along the final push from the shoulder point was nothing short of enthralling.

The descend from the peak was an altogether a different experience. We were not able to predict whether our next step down would bury our feet two-three feet into the ground. We truly understood the necessity of spikes while coming down as the the initial part of the descent was completely covered with snow. WHen the descent slope was not so harmful (not with boulders) our instructors allowed us to slide through the path. As I was new to this, the inital attempt was horrible as I rolled over due to incorrect form. Also, I had not worn any gloves and stopping my acceleration with my bare hands caused some bruises on my palm as I skid through the snow.

After descending to kedarkanta base camp at around 1:30 PM we had our lunch served at 2:00PM. All of us, as we were tired slept peacefully in the tents for a couple hours and assembled in our dinner tent. The dinner tent at various camp sites had become a pub house for the couple days for us as we started playing music and dancing for them. This night was one of the most memorable due to two things, one is the couple dance from all the boys and the other is the Jamoon that the TTH served us for the dinner that night. Overall it was an amazing experience as we slept thinking about the long descent to sankri the next day. 


### Day 8 - Descending to Sankri
As there was some water issues in harki dun(?? name correct?), we had not descended on the summit day and hence the next day after the summit, we had to descent till Sankri, our starting camp and it was a descent of 6-7kms, longest distance and descent of our trek. We started at around 8:30 AM as we had to reach the camp by 1:30 PM. We had found a leftout frisbee in our campsite the previous night, which we used in our rest point while descending to play frisbee.

After half the distance was covered, I started to feel irritations in both of my feet due as blisters were getting formed due to improper fit. As I decided to descend slowly to avoid further bruise, Aashish helped in me tighing the shoes properly so that the shoes did not slide and cause more irritation when I descended slowly. As we reached the point where it led to the main road leading the sankri base camp, we were filled with mixed emotions, the happiness of the successful summit , the sadness of the trip coming to and end, etc. However, that did not stop us doing our own version of "Pawri" in the end, which for obvious reason, cannot be shared XD. The realization that the trip is to coming to an end made some of us emotional and together with an awesome dinner (as always) by TTH helped us cope the emotions as we slept peacefully before the complete travelling the next day.

### Day 9 - The long travel back to Bangalore.
As we had to reach the Dehradun airport by at least 4:00PM, we had to leave sankri by 6:00 AM. As per the plan, we had tea at 5:00 AM so that we would be ready to leave by 5:30 AM. And we left Sankri TTH Camp at around 5:45 and were on road. As everyone's stomach were empty we felt a little nauseous until we stopped for breakfast. The Aloo paratha by one of the DABAs in mussori was heaven sent as we gobbled two of it and resumed our journey. After a long tiring journey with one break for lunch (the hotel was awful), we reached Dehradun airport at around 3:45 PM. After some rest we bid farewell to Rohan who had his flight little bit earlier than us.

Our layover was at Delhi and the flight that took us was a turboflops airplane and the experience with that was quite funny and scary at the same time, the sound and the turbulence it made while it flew were funny at times. After landing at Delhi, people who had access to lounge had a sumptious meal and the rest gobbled at the Mcd. Our flight to bangalore was at 10:45 PM and we reached bangalore at 1:45AM and it was around 3:00-4:00 AM when most of us went home with a heavy heart full of memories from the trip.'
