	<p>Hey there! This is Sriharsha, I have experience working in Knowledge graphs at Tivo Metadata team and also have experience in working on large software systems focusing on new IPTV initiaves at Xperi (formerly Tivo Corp). I am documenting my learning notes on theoretical machine learning and personal life experiences in this blog. </p>

			<li>Olaf Ronneberger et al. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597">U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation</a></li>
			<li>Zongwei Zhou et al. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10165">UNet++: A Nested U-Net Architecture for Medical Image Segmentation</a></li>

			<li>Yuhua Li et al. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232645326_Sentence_Similarity_Based_on_Semantic_Nets_and_Corpus_Statistics">Sentence Similarity Based on Semantic Nets and Corpus Statistics.</a> my first paper read.</li>
		</ol>
	</p>

	<p>My current interests lie in exploring current methodologies in NLP to mitigate human and societal bias. I also like to dabble with improving software systems to handle huge amount of data.</p>
